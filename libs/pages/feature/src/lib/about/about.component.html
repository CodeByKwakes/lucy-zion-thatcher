          <!-- <h3>About Lucy Zion Thatcher</h3> -->
          <p>
            Lucy Thatcher is a writer, speaker and a sexual health adviser for
            the NHS. She has worked in sexual health clinics for over 15 years,
            across 5 London Boroughs. She has extensive knowledge of working
            with young people, victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and
            sexual exploitation and those from the LGBTQ+ community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucy works to identify and fill the gaps in people’s sexual health
            education to empower them to make better decisions about their
            sexual health and relationships. She believes good self-esteem and
            education is the foundation of healthy choices and so she aims to
            reduce the shame and critical views people have of themselves and
            others by providing a safe and non-judgemental space to speak openly
            about sexual experiences and concerns, whilst providing accurate
            information and gently challenging people to consider a more
            compassionate position on some of their more judgemental and
            stigmatising points of view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucy’s passion for sexual health has developed in tandem with her
            love of poetry. In 2017 she shone as a performance poet taking on
            projects exploring maternal mental health as well as black women in
            politics. In January 2020 she released her first book ‘Small
            Thoughts and Poetry’ quickly followed by ‘Naked’ in 2022 which
            explores themes such as unhealthy relationships and body acceptance
            through poetry and photography.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucy brings her full authenticity to the work she does by drawing on
            personal experience, her cultural upbringing and her creativity to
            adapt and appeal to a range of audiences through a variety of
            mediums.

          <p style="font-style: italic">
            The benefits of a healthy sex life are numerous. They include better
            sleep, less stress, decreased depression and anxiety as well as
            improved immune systems and self-esteem. So, in short healthier sex
            lives lead to happier people. My aim is to lift the shame of talking
            about sex in families and in relationships to encourage people to
            know, understand and clearly communicate their sexual boundaries,
            have a good knowledge of consent and how to establish it and how to
            negotiate the type of sex they like so we can all have a healthier
            and more pleasurable sex life.
